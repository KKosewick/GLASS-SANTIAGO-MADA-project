This shows some materials that could go into a supplementary file. Often you want/need references here too. You can use the same reference bib file for this and the main text (as done here) or have separate bib files.

For illustrative purposes, I'm doing the supplement as pdf. For this to work, you need a (La)TeX system installed. It's easy. Just follow [these steps](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).

Of course you would choose the format based on needs.

I'm also using a different style for the references here. (vancouver vs apa in the main manuscript). Usually one would have the formatting of the references the same in those two documents, but I want to illustrate how easy it is to switch reference formatting styles, you just need to get the right CSL file and specify it in the YAML header. We could also have a seperate reference bibtext (`.bib`) file, but here we are using the same.

# Overview

Readers will be able to find our analysis of the different contraception methods through figures we've made for the `pct_upreg_larcster`, `pct_upreg_trad`, and `pct_upreg_nouse` variables.  

```{r}
# explore the percentage of unintended pregnancies related to long acting reversible methods in each country
p2 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_larcster)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  ggtitle("Percent Unintended Pregnancy Using Long Acting Reversible Methods") + xlab("Percentage") + ylab("Number of Countries")
plot(p2)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_larcster_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p2) 


# explore the percentage of unintended pregnancies related to traditional methods in each country
p4 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_trad)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Percent Unintended Pregnancy Using Traditional Methods") + xlab("Percentage") + ylab("Number of Countries")
plot(p4)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_trad_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p4) 


# explore the percentage of unintended pregnancies related to no birth control usage in each country
p5 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_nouse)) +
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Percent Unintended Pregnancy Using No Birth Control") + xlab("Percentage") + ylab("Number of countries")
plot(p5)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_nouse_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p5) 
```

P2: This histogram is highly skewed right, which shows that most countries experience a very low percentage of unintended pregnancies related to long acting reversible and sterilization methods. 

P4: This histogram shows that about half of the countries reported less than 10% percent of unintended pregnancies associated with using traditional birth control methods 

P5: This histogram shows that more countries report a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies among women who do not use any contraception, but it varies widely by country.


The following set of plots revealed large outliers in the 'total_larcster`,'total_trad', and `total_none` variables, which prevented the graphs from being very useful. The histograms look like most observations for each of these four variables are 0, but that is not possible because the summary table showed that the minimum value for all four of these variables is greater than 0. This distortion is caused by the two large outliers in the data set.    

```{r}
# explore the total number of people using long acting reversible methods in each country
p6 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=total_larcster)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Total Usage of Long Acting Reversible Methods per Country") + xlab("Number of Women") + ylab("Number of Countries")
plot(p6)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "total_larcster_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p6) 

# explore the total number of people using traditional methods in each country
p8 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=total_trad)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Total Usage of Traditional Methods per Country") + xlab("Number of Women") + ylab("Number of Countries")
plot(p8)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "total_trad_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p8) 

# explore the total number of people not using birth control in each country
p9 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=total_none)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  ggtitle("Total Usage of No Birth Control Method per Country") + xlab("Number of Women") + ylab("Number of Countries")
plot(p9)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "total_none_distribution.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p9) 

```
Plot 10 shows `pct_upreg_larcster` vs `larcster_standard` to analyze women using long acting reversible methods and sterilization versus the percentage of unintended pregnancies using those methods.

```{r}
# explore percentage of unintended pregnancies compared to standardized count of women using long-acting reversible and sterilization methods
p10 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_larcster, y=larcster_standard)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using LARCs") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p10)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctuppreg_totallarcster.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p10) 
```


P10: As the standardized count of women using LARCs and sterilization methods increases, the percentage of unintended pregnancies tends to increase. There is minimal variation around the linear equation, excluding the two largest percentages accounted for by India and China.

Plot 12 shows `pct_upreg_trad` versus `trad_standard` 
```{r}
# explore percentage of unintended pregnancies compared to standardized count of women using traditional methods
p12 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_trad, y=trad_standard)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using Traditional Methods") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p12)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totaltrad.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p12) 
```

P12: As percentage of unintended pregnancies associated with traditional methods increases, the total number of women using this method increases. There is minimal variation in the trend when percentage of unintended pregnancies is less than 8%, but there is more variation when the percentage is greater than 10%. 

Plot 13 shows `pct_upreg_nouse` versus `none_standard`
```{r}
# explore percentage of unintended pregnancies compared to standardized count of women not using no method
p13 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_nouse, y=none_standard)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using No Method") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p13)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totalnone.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p13) 
```


P13: The same expected positive trend is observed for women who are not using a birth control method, but there is considerable variation in this graph across all percentages of unintended pregnancies. Additionally, the lowest percentage in this category is around 35%, which is much higher than the percentages associated with the three birth control methods. 



We are also interested in how these relationships between percent of unintended pregnancies using each birth control method and the number of people using each method varies across region. We adjusted the original scatter plots created above by coloring based on region.
```{r}
# explore percent unintended pregnancies using long acting reversible and sterilziation methods by region
p14 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_larcster, y=larcster_standard, color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using LARCs") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p14)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_larcster_stratified.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p14) 


# explore percent unintended pregnancies using traditional methods by region
p16 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_trad, y=trad_standard, color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +  
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using Traditional Methods") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p16)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_trad_stratified.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p16) 

# explore percent unintended pregnancies using no method by region
p17 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x=pct_upreg_nouse, y=none_standard, color = region)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +   
  ggtitle("Percent of Unintended Pregnancies vs Standardzied Count of Women Using No Method") + xlab("Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies") + ylab("Standarized Total Number of Women")
plot(p17)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_none_stratified.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p17) 

```

P14: Among women using long acting reversible and sterilization methods, Asia has the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies, followed by Latin America/the Caribbean and Africa.


P16: Among women using traditional birth control methods, Europe has the sharpest increase in unintended pregnancies as population increases, but Asia has the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies in this category. 

P17: This graph is much different than the other three, which is to be expected at this point. Oceania has the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies when women are not using birth control. The slope of the relationship for each region appears to be similar in this graph with the exception of Oceania having a steeper slope. There are considerably more outliers in this graph with African countries 


Our next group of plots will be violin plots to explore the usage level of each birth control method, a categorical variable, associated with percentage of unintended pregnancies use for each birth control method, a numerical variable.
```{r}
# explore long acting reversible and sterilization method usage compared to percent of unintended pregnancies
p18 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x = larcster_usage, y = pct_upreg_larcster)) +
  geom_violin() +
  ggtitle("Usage of LARCs and Sterilization vs Percent of Unintended Pregnancies") +
  labs(x = "Long Acting Reversible and Sterilization Usage", y = "Percentage Unintended Pregnancies") 
plot(p18)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "larcster_pctupreg_violin.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p18) 


# explore traditional method usage compared to percent of unintended pregnancies
p20 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x = trad_usage, y = pct_upreg_trad)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  ggtitle("Usage of Traditional Method vs Percent of Unintended Pregnancies") +
  labs(x = "Traditional Method Usage", y = "Percentage Unintended Pregnancies") 
plot(p20)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "trad_pctupreg_violin.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p20) 

# explore no method usage compared to percent of unintended pregnancies
p21 <- mydata %>% ggplot(aes(x = none_usage, y = pct_upreg_nouse)) +
  geom_violin() +  
  ggtitle("No Birth Control Usage vs Percent of Unintended Pregnancies") +
  labs(x = "No Birth Control Usage", y = "Percentage Unintended Pregnancies") 
plot(p21)
figure_file = here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "none_pctupreg_violin.png")
ggsave(filename = figure_file, plot=p21) 

```

P18: The distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies varies a lot among usage levels of long acting reversible and sterilization methods. High usage countries have a consistent percentage of unintended pregnancies, but countries with a medium usage level tend to have lower percentages of unintended pregnancies. 

P20: Among women using traditional birth control methods, the distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies is similar among medium and high usage countries, but low usage countries are skewed towards lower percentage of unintended pregnancies. 

P21: While the distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies is similar across the three usage levels for women not using any birth control method, the high usage countries appear to have a bottleneck in percentage of unintended pregnancies. The high and low usage countries appear to be skewed towards higher levels of unintended pregnancies, but the medium usage countries appear to have lower percentage of unintended pregnancies.
