## Project Part 1  
# Data Source 
The data source for this project is the Guttmacher Institute, which is a well-known research organization focusing on improving sexual and reproductive health around the world. The data used here is from their Adding It Up project. The goals of this project include estimating the need for, impact of, and costs associated with providing sexual and reproductive health services. Low and middle income countries are the target audience for this research, specifically women of reproductive age (15-49). Some of the variables included in this dataset are modern contraceptive use, unintended pregnancies, unplanned births, and abortions averted. Observations are drawn from nationally representative surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys, UNICCEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, US Centers for Disease Control Reproductive Health Surveys, Performance Monitoring for Action Surveys, and others. The UN Population Division is the source of population projections for women in this age group, and estimates of unintended pregnancies are from the Guttmacher Institute, WHO, and other authors, which have been adjusted to 2019. 

# Load and describe the data 
```{r}
library(here)
AIUdata <- read_csv(here("data", "raw-data", "AIU All Women Dataset.csv"))
dim(AIUdata)
str(AIUdata)
```
There are 132 observations, one row for each low- to middle- income country, of the 399 variable included in the Adding It Up All Women Dataset. Some examples of numeric variables included are percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are three important character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. 

# Summarize the data 
```{r}
table(AIUdata$region)
table(AIUdata$subregion)
summary(AIUdata$pct_upreg)
ggplot(AIUdata, aes(x = country, y = pct_upreg, fill = region)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage Unintended Pregnancies by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Percentage")
```
The dataset includes 53 African countries, 36 Asian countries, 11 European Countries, 24 Latin American/Caribbean countries, and 8 Oceanic countries.There are 16 subregions that provide better detail about each country's location. The average percentage of unintended pregnancies at the country level is 46.79%. with a maximum of 75.65%. This variable has 24 missing values, which will need to be cleaned.  A simple visualization shows that African and Latin American/Carribean countries have the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies. 

# Research Questions
1) Is there a significant difference in the percentage of unplanned pregnancies between contraceptive methods among all countries? Does this difference vary by region?
The main outcome variables will be total percentage of unintended pregnancies per birth control method (`pct_upreg_larcster`, `pct_upreg_sarc`, `pct_upreg_trad`). 
The control variable will be total percentage of unintended pregnancies among women not using birth control (`pct_upreg_none`)
The predictor variables will include the total number of people women using each type of birth control standardized by population size, which will be utilized to create a factor variable showing low, medium, and high usage for each method per country. 
Covariates will include the number of women using each of these methods across four different age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, and 35-49. 
-Number of women 15-19 using long-acting reversible methods `larc_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using short-acting methods `sarc_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using traditional methods `tradmethods_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using no method `nomethod_1519`
-Number of women 20-24 using long-acting reversible methods `larc_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using short-acting methods	`sarc_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using traditional methods	`tradmethods_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using no method	`nomethod_2024`
-Number of women 25-34 using long-acting reversible methods	`larc_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using short-acting methods	`sarc_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using traditional methods	`tradmethods_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using no method	`nomethod_2534`
-Number of women 35-49 using long-acting reversible method	`larc_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using short-acting method	`sarc_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using all traditional methods	`tradmethods_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using no method	`nomethod_3549`  

We will be looking for patterns in contraceptive methods and higher unintended pregnancies across age groups to investigate the effectiveness of each method. We hope to find relationships between subregions, rates of unintended pregnancies, and contraceptive methods to determine possible interventions that will increase the effectiveness of contraceptive methods.

# How to analyze 
All of the variables used in this analysis are numeric, so we can build linear regression models to analyze how each method of contraception affects the percentage of unintended pregnancies. We can group countries together based on the subregion variable to compare how these relationships vary across the world as shown in the crude visualization above. There are other interesting variables that can be used for grouping for analysis such as wealth, urban/rural location, and marriage status.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

We will be looking for patterns in contraceptive methods and higher unintended pregnancies across age groups (20-24) and (35-49) to investigate the effectiveness of each contraceptive method.Financial, social, religious, and cultural factors are current challenges against efforts towards reducing unintended pregnancies. According to a cross-sectional survey done in 2017, contraceptive use was prevalent among women who had attained higher education, were in stable partnerships, and identified with the dominant ethnic group. Additionally, factors like previous pregnancies and immigration status did not appear to influence contraceptive use in this study. The table provided above under `Summarize the data` shows that African and Latin American/Caribbean countries have the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies. This could be due to the current legal status of contraception within Latin American countries. Free emergency contraception access exists, but regulations differ. Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador legally recognize access, while Nicaragua and Bolivia rely on Ministerial protocols. Argentina and Brazil lack legal recognition, but offer protocols and guides. Mexico requires provision to victims of sexual and domestic violence (Hevia, 2012).



## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

This data originates from the Guttmacher Institute's Adding It Up project. The data contains numeric variables: percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are only three  character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. So far we have dvided the observations into "low", "medium", and "high" category of birth control usage. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

1. How does marriage status affect percentage of unintended pregnancies across different types of birth control?

2. Is there a significant difference in the percentage of unplanned pregnancies between reversible contraceptives (LARCs?) among the age groups (20-24) and (35-49)?



To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a].

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._


## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). @fig-schematic is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("products","assets","antigen-recognition.png"))
```




## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._


@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```



## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._


@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
