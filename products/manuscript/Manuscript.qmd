# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

We will be looking for patterns in contraceptive methods and higher unintended pregnancies across all age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-35, and 35-49) to investigate the effectiveness of three contraceptive methods: long acting reversible and sterilization,  short acting reversible, and traditional. Financial, social, religious, and cultural factors are current challenges against efforts towards reducing unintended pregnancies. According to a cross-sectional survey done in 2017, contraceptive use was prevalent among women who had attained higher education, were in stable partnerships, and identified with the dominant ethnic group. Additionally, factors like previous pregnancies and immigration status did not appear to influence contraceptive use in this study. African and Latin American/Caribbean countries have the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies. This could be due to the current legal status of contraception within Latin American countries. Free emergency contraception access exists, but regulations differ. Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador legally recognize access, while Nicaragua and Bolivia rely on Ministerial protocols. Argentina and Brazil lack legal recognition, but offer protocols and guides. Mexico requires provision to victims of sexual and domestic violence (Hevia, 2012).


## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._
The data source for this project is the Guttmacher Institute, which is a well-known research organization focusing on improving sexual and reproductive health around the world. The data used here is from their Adding It Up project. The goals of this project include estimating the need for, impact of, and costs associated with providing sexual and reproductive health services. Low and middle income countries are the target audience for this research, specifically women of reproductive age (15-49). Some of the variables included in this dataset are modern contraceptive use, unintended pregnancies, unplanned births, and abortions averted. Observations are drawn from nationally representative surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys, UNICCEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, US Centers for Disease Control Reproductive Health Surveys, Performance Monitoring for Action Surveys, and others. The UN Population Division is the source of population projections for women in this age group, and estimates of unintended pregnancies are from the Guttmacher Institute, WHO, and other authors, which have been adjusted to 2019. 

For the purpose of this project, we chose several numeric variables from the data source: percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are only three character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

1) Is there a significant difference in the percentage of unintended pregnancies among short acting reversible contraception users among region? 

The main outcome variables will be total percentage of unintended pregnancies among women using short acting reversible contraception methods (`pct_upreg_sarc`).

The predictor variables will include the total number of people women using each type of birth control standardized by population size, region, percentage of women currently married, percentage of women never married, total rate of maternal deaths, rate of maternal deaths due to unintended pregnancy and rate of maternal deaths due to abortion. 
    
A full list of variables can be found in the processing-file in the code > processing-code folder.

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._
Reproducing this project requires R, RStudio, and Microsoft word. The README files in each folder contain descriptions of the documents located in that folder to help guide users through the reproducible processes. Begin with the processing-file.qmd in the code > processing-code folder. This file loads the original dataset from the Guttmacher Institute's Adding It Up project, loads the codebook for the dataset, and glimpses at the data. We chose 30 variables to clean to find the percentage of unintended pregnancies based on each type of contraceptive methods: long acting reversible and sterilization methods, short acting reversible methods, traditional methods, and no contraceptive usage. After the missing data was explored, we chose to use the percentage of unintended pregnancies variables related to each method of birth control because the total variable had unexplained missingness. The processed data is saved in the data > processed-data folder as processeddata.rds. 

The next step is exploratory data analysis. The eda.qmd file in the code > eda-code folder contains all the code for this process. We produced a couple summary tables before we began a simple exploration of trends in percentage of unintended pregnancies by country in our first set of histograms. The second set of histograms explore contraceptive usage methods by country. These graphs revealed outliers, so we standardized by population size for each country. The next sets of plots are line graphs showing total usage of contraceptive methods to percentage of unintended pregnancies associated with that method. The last two sets of plots contain line graphs of the relationship between the two variables stratified by region and violin plots displaying the relationship between percentage of unintended pregnancies and the categorical usage variable created during processing. All of these figures are saved in the Supplementary-Material.qmd file in the products > manuscript > supplement folder. This process led us to focus on the percentage of unintended pregnancies among short acting reversible methods as our single outcome because this method is becoming increasingly popular, so we feel that results from this contraception method will be the most relevant. Additionally, the exploratory data analysis process showed that the distribution of this outcome variable is less skewed than the other options, and the stratification by region is clearer, which allows for better understanding. 

Step three is the statistical analysis and model fitting portion found in the statistical-analysis.qmd file in the code > analysis-code folder. We explore the single outcome `pct_upreg_sarc` based on 7 predictors with simple linear regression, total number of women using short acting reversible methods, region, percent of currently married women, percent of women who never married, total rate of maternal mortality, rate of maternal mortality by unintended pregnancy, and rate of maternal mortality by abortion. We also explore the differences in the outcome between regions using an ANOVA test and Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test for pairwise comparisons within ANOVA. Result tables for each model and test are stored in the results > tables folder. 

Step four is to critically analyze the performance of our models to determine which one performs the best in predicting our outcome, which is also done in the statistical-analysis.qmd file in the code > analysis-code folder. We chose 2 performance metrics to find for each of our 9 models: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). We chose these performance metrics because they are commonly used for linear regression models like the ones we have created. RMSE provides an average magnitude of the error in the predictors, and MAE provides an average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. We include both metrics to increase the validity of our results. Once we decided on the final model, we use cross-validation to determine how well it will perform on data it has not seen before.

## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._

This research aims to analyze the factors influencing unintended pregnancies and contraception use in low-and-middle-income countries. The Guttmacher Institute's Adding It Up project provides the foundation, offering data on sexual and reproductive health services in these regions.Focusing on women of reproductive age (15-49), the study usese information from nationally representative surveys and population projections to estimate unintended pregnancy rates.

While data on the overall percentage of unintended pregnancies was unavailable, we strategically utilized data on rates related to specific birth control methods. This approach allows us to analyze the relationship between these rates and various social and health factors. Factors like the number of women utilizing different birth control methods, maternal death rates, and marital status will be meticulously examined. All 7 of these predictor variables were found within the study's codebook, which can can be found in the `Data` folder of this project. By discovering these relationships, the research aims to shed light on the complex landscape of contraception use and unintended pregnancy in low-and -middle-income countries. This knowledge can empower policymakers and healthcare providers to make informed decisions that ultimately improve reproductive health outcomes for women.


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._
We began with a simple linear regression model with each of the 7 predictor variables to determine the association betwen each variable and the outcome. We explored the region variable further because our main goal is to understand the difference in outcome by region. We used ANOVA to determine the difference between regions, and we added Tukey's Honeslty Significant Difference test to examine pairwise associations. This led to discovering correlations between some of the predictors, which we examined through correlation coefficients. We tried out a combination of these correlated predictors in 2 different models to further examine the interactions. After considering which predictors are most impactful on our outcome, we narrowed the final predictors down to a list of 5. We included a multiple linear regression model with all 5 of these predictors. We used the RMSE and MAE performance metrics to evaluate all 9 models that we created to determine which one fit best. Lastly, we used cross-validation to determine how well our multiple linear regression model performs on data it has not seen before.

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

After deciding on a single outcome variable, we created a summary table with that outcome and the seven predictors we will use to predict it, which can be seen @tbl-summarytable.
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Summary table of numeric variables"
#| echo: FALSE
predictortable<- readRDS(here("results", "tables", "predictortable.rds"))
predictortable
```

We created a multitude of exploratory plots to understand our data better. The first @exploratory-result shows the distribution of the outcome variable: percent of unintended pregnancies due to short acting reversible methods. The `pct_upreg_sarc` variable is slightly skewed to the right with an average around 12%.
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of Percentage of Unintended Pregnancy Use by Birth Control Method"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_sarc_distribution.png"))
```

The next set of variables we explored were the total counts of women using each birth control method. There were two large outliers that prevented the graphs from being useful. After exploring the outliers, we standardized using the population size of reproductive aged women (15-49 years). There is a positive association between the percentage of unintended pregnancies among short acting reversible method users and the total number of women using that method of birth control, which is to be expected. This association is displayed in @exploratory-result2.
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result2
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies and Standardized Population Total"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totalsarc.png"))
```

We stratified these four graphs by region to examine how the relationship differs across each of the t regions which is shown in @exploratory-result3 . The graph for short acting reversible methods shows clearer differences between regions, and Latin America/the Caribbean leads in the percentage of unintended pregnancies in this category, but Africa shows the sharpest increase in percentage of unintended pregnancies as the total population increases.
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result3
#| fig-cap: "Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies Stratified by Region"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_sarc_stratified.png"))
```

We also created violin plots using the categorical usage variables for each birth control method as shown in @exploratory-result4. It appears that the distribution of short acting reversible method usage is skewed towards lower percentages of unintended pregnancies across all usage levels, suggesting that more countries have lower percentage of unintended pregnancies among women using this method. The high usage countries appear to have a bottleneck in percentage of unintended pregnancies. The high and low usage countries appear to be skewed towards higher levels of unintended pregnancies, but the medium usage countries appear to have lower percentage of unintended pregnancies. 
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result4
#| fig-cap: "Violin Plots with Birth Control Usage Levels"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "sarc_pctupreg_violin.png"))
```

Lastly, we explored the predictor variables that will be used in our models, and the graphs are shown in @exploratory-result5. The Africa region accounts for most of the observations with about 53 countries, followed by Asia that includes. about 35 countries. Latin America/the Caribbean accounts for about 25 countries. Europe and Oceania account for the least number of observations. The distribution of women currently married is approximately normal with an average around 57% and no major outliers. The distribution of women never married is slightly skewed to the right with an average around 30%, but there are a few outliers greater than 60%. The distribution of the total maternal mortality rate is highly skewed to the right with a couple outliers. We would have expected the highest rates to belong to India and China because they have the most people, but it is Chad, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan that account for the highest rates of total maternal mortality. The distribution of the maternal mortality rate from unintended pregnancies is highly skewed to the right with a couple outliers, which is to be expected based on the trend shown in the previous histogram. Chad and South Sudan also account for the highest rates of maternal mortality in this category. The distribution of maternal mortality rate from abortions is also highly skewed to the right. The outliers are accounted for by Gambia and Mauritania in this predictor.

```


## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

We completed a simple linear regression analysis with each of the 7 predictors shown in @statistical-analysis1. The predictor with the strongest relationship with the outcome is total number of women using short acting reversible methods (`sarc_standard`). 

```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis1
#| fig-cap: "Strongest Predictor: sarc_standard"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable1.rds")) 
```

The second model we created used the region predictor, which revealed that the Latin America/the Caribbean region had the strongest relationship with the outcome variable followed closely by the Asia region. The Oceania region does not appear to have a strong effect on the outcome variable with the Europe region only showing a slightly larger association. These associations can be seen in @statistical-analysis2.
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis2
#| fig-cap: "Regional Predictor"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable2.rds")) 
```
Details about the 9 different models we created can be found in the statistical-analysis.qmd file in the code > analysis-code folder along with an exploration of the correlation between predictors.

## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

We wanted to analyze the differences in the outcome between regions further, so we completed an ANOVA test and subsequet Tukey HSD test. The Tukey HSD test for the region predictor, shown in @statistical-analysis3, revealed the largest differences in the outcome between the Oceania region and Latin America/the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia. The differences between Oceania and Europe and Latin America/the Caribbean are the largest. Oceania is clearly experiencing the lowest percentage of unintended pregnancies among short acting reversible method users. Two more significant differences in the outcome exist between Latin America/the Caribbean and Europe with Africa, which shows that Africa is experiencing higher levels of the outcome. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis3
#| fig-cap: "Tukey HSD Test Results"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable13.rds")) 
```
We created one model with all 5 predictors using multiple linear regression, shown in @statistcal-analysis4. This model shows the strongest predictor is the number of women using short acting reversible contraception. The next strongest predictor is the European region followed by the Latin America/the Caribbean region and the Asia region, which is a shift from the model with the singular region predictor. The Oceania region now has a negative association with the outcome. The currently married predictor is associated with a weak decrease in the outcome. The coefficient estimates for the rate of maternal death due to unintended pregnancies and abortion both show a very weak positive association with the outcome. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis4
#| fig-cap: "Multiple Linear Regression with 5 Predictors"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable8.rds")) 
```
To determine which model performed the best, we started by examining the RMSE and MAE performance metrics. We found that the model with the standardized total count of women using the short acting reversible contraception method performed the best in a single predictor model compared to the percent of currently married women and the rate of maternal mortality due to abortion. @statistical-analysis5 shows the RMSE and MAE values for each of these three models compared to the null model with no predictors. The model with the population size using SARCs is the only single predictor model that performs better than the null. The full model with all 5 predictors peforms the best with the lowest RMSE and MAE values. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis5
#| fig-cap: "Performance Metric Comparisons"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable14.rds")) 
```
We used cross-validation of the two best models to determine how well the model performs on data it has not seen yet by splitting the data into testing and training pieces. The cross-validated results, shown in @statistical-analysis6 lead to the same conclusion: the multiple linear regression model with 5 predictors performs better. The RMSE value for the single predictor model with `sarc_standard` is 4.822226, which is lower the the first RMSE value of 5.143319. While the RMSE value for the multiple linear regression model is slightly higher than the first time it was calculated, it is still lower than the single predictor model. Additionally, the standard error of the RMSE for the multiple linear regression model is 0.2768, which is lower than the standard error of the RMSE for the single predictor model of 0.3528. This means there is higher variance in the single predictor model. The R-squared value of 0.8206 for the multiple linear regression model is higher than 0.7861 for the single predictor model, which means the multiple linear regression model accounts for more of the variability in the data. Overall, the multiple linear regression model performs better.
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis6
#| fig-cap: "Cross Validation Performance Metric Comparisons"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable15.rds")) 
```

Since we determined that the full model with all 5 predictors performs best, we graphed the predicted versus observed values using this model with both the testing and training data to further examine model performance. As seen in @statistical-analysis7, the training model predictions, shown in teal, hover pretty closely around the expected relationship between the outcome and the 5 predictors, which is depicted as the 45 degree line. The testing model predictions, shown in coral, are much more extreme than the training model predictions because they are farther from the 45 degree line. While there is some overlap between the two sets of predictions, it is likely that our model is overfitting the data. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis7
#| fig-cap: "Evaluating Final Model Performance on Test Data"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "final-figures", "fullmodelpred.png"))
```
We went one step further to examine the uncertainty in the full model predictions using the bootstrap method with 100 resamples of the training data. The figure shown in @statistical-analysis8 displays the 95% confidence intervals, shown as dark blue lines, for the predictions made by the model. The confidence intervals are narrow, which shows there is minimal uncertainty in the model prediction. For the predictions that do not fall on the expected 45 degree line, the confidence intervals do not intersect with the line either. These findings increase the validity of the conclusion that the model is overfitting the data because there is not much uncertainty in the predictions. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis8
#| fig-cap: "Evaluation of Uncertainty in Full Model Predictions"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "final-figures", "bootstrappred.png"))
```

Since we have evidence that our model overfits the data, the last technique we want to use to explore our full model is Lasso regression. This technique could reveal predictors that should not be included in our final model, which could reduce the risk of overfitting. As seen in @statistical-analysis9, the LASSO regression coefficients are much smaller than the first full model we created without the regularization penalty, but all 5 predictors remain in the model. The `sarc_standard` predictor still has the strongest relationship with the outcome. The percent of women currently married, rate of maternal deaths due to unintended pregnancies, and rate of maternal deaths to due to abortion all have weak negative associations with the outcome. This process confirms that our final model should contain all 5 predictors. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis9
#| fig-cap: "LASSO Regression Results"
#| echo: FALSE
readRDS(here("results","tables", "resulttable16.rds")) 
```
It is important to tune the hyperparameters associated with LASSO regression to determine the model that fits best, which is shown in @statistical-analysis10. As the regularization penalty increases past 1, we see that the RMSE value increases exponentially. The lowest RMSE for the model is slightly greater than 5 when the regularization penalty is less than 1. When the regularization penalty increases to 10, the RMSE increases to almost 11. Since we originally chose 0.1 as our penalty parameter, we found one of the best performing models with the LASSO regression based on an RMSE value slightly greater than 5, which i comparable to the RMSE found in the first regression model with all 5 predictors. 
```{r}
#| label: statistical-analysis10
#| fig-cap: "Parameter Tuning for LASSO Regression"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "final-figures", "lassoparameters.png"))
```
