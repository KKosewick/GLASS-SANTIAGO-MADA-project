## Project Part 1  

# Data Source 
The data source for this project is the Guttmacher Institute, which is a well-known research organization focusing on improving sexual and reproductive health around the world. The data used here is from their Adding It Up project. The goals of this project include estimating the need for, impact of, and costs associated with providing sexual and reproductive health services. Low and middle income countries are the target audience for this research, specifically women of reproductive age (15-49). Some of the variables included in this dataset are modern contraceptive use, unintended pregnancies, unplanned births, and abortions averted. Observations are drawn from nationally representative surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys, UNICCEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, US Centers for Disease Control Reproductive Health Surveys, Performance Monitoring for Action Surveys, and others. The UN Population Division is the source of population projections for women in this age group, and estimates of unintended pregnancies are from the Guttmacher Institute, WHO, and other authors, which have been adjusted to 2019. 

# Load and describe the data 
```{r}
library(here)
AIUdata <- read_csv(here("data", "raw-data", "AIU All Women Dataset.csv"))
dim(AIUdata)
str(AIUdata)
```
There are 132 observations, one row for each low- to middle- income country, of the 399 variable included in the Adding It Up All Women Dataset. Some examples of numeric variables included are percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are three important character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. 

# Summarize the data 
```{r}
table(AIUdata$region)
table(AIUdata$subregion)
summary(AIUdata$pct_upreg)
ggplot(AIUdata, aes(x = country, y = pct_upreg, fill = region)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Percentage Unintended Pregnancies by Country",
       x = "Country",
       y = "Percentage")
```
The dataset includes 53 African countries, 36 Asian countries, 11 European Countries, 24 Latin American/Caribbean countries, and 8 Oceanic countries.There are 16 subregions that provide better detail about each country's location. The average percentage of unintended pregnancies at the country level is 46.79%. with a maximum of 75.65%. This variable has 24 missing values, which will need to be cleaned.  A simple visualization shows that African and Latin American/Carribean countries have the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies. 

# Research Questions
1) Is there a significant difference in the percentage of unplanned pregnancies between contraceptive methods among all countries? Does this difference vary by region?
The main outcome variables will be total percentage of unintended pregnancies per birth control method (`pct_upreg_larcster`, `pct_upreg_sarc`, `pct_upreg_trad`). 
The control variable will be total percentage of unintended pregnancies among women not using birth control (`pct_upreg_none`)
The predictor variables will include the total number of people women using each type of birth control standardized by population size, which will be utilized to create a factor variable showing low, medium, and high usage for each method per country. 
Covariates will include the number of women using each of these methods across four different age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-34, and 35-49. These variables will be combined across age groups to create a total usage variable for each method. 
-Number of women 15-19 using long-acting reversible methods `larc_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using short-acting methods `sarc_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using traditional methods `tradmethods_1519`
-Number of women 15-19 using no method `nomethod_1519`
-Number of women 20-24 using long-acting reversible methods `larc_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using short-acting methods	`sarc_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using traditional methods	`tradmethods_2024`
-Number of women 20-24 using no method	`nomethod_2024`
-Number of women 25-34 using long-acting reversible methods	`larc_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using short-acting methods	`sarc_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using traditional methods	`tradmethods_2534`
-Number of women 25-34 using no method	`nomethod_2534`
-Number of women 35-49 using long-acting reversible method	`larc_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using short-acting method	`sarc_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using all traditional methods	`tradmethods_3549`
-Number of women 35-49 using no method	`nomethod_3549`  

We will be looking for patterns in contraceptive methods and higher unintended pregnancies across age groups to investigate the effectiveness of each method. We hope to find relationships between subregions, rates of unintended pregnancies, and contraceptive methods to determine possible interventions that will increase the effectiveness of contraceptive methods.

# How to analyze 
All of the variables used in this analysis are numeric, so we can build linear regression models to analyze how each method of contraception affects the percentage of unintended pregnancies. We can group countries together based on the subregion variable to compare how these relationships vary across the world as shown in the crude visualization above. There are other interesting variables that can be used for grouping for analysis such as wealth, urban/rural location, and marriage status.

# Introduction 

## General Background Information
_Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis_ 

We will be looking for patterns in contraceptive methods and higher unintended pregnancies across all age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-35, and 35-49) to investigate the effectiveness of each contraceptive method. Financial, social, religious, and cultural factors are current challenges against efforts towards reducing unintended pregnancies. According to a cross-sectional survey done in 2017, contraceptive use was prevalent among women who had attained higher education, were in stable partnerships, and identified with the dominant ethnic group. Additionally, factors like previous pregnancies and immigration status did not appear to influence contraceptive use in this study. The table provided above under `Summarize the data` shows that African and Latin American/Caribbean countries have the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies. This could be due to the current legal status of contraception within Latin American countries. Free emergency contraception access exists, but regulations differ. Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador legally recognize access, while Nicaragua and Bolivia rely on Ministerial protocols. Argentina and Brazil lack legal recognition, but offer protocols and guides. Mexico requires provision to victims of sexual and domestic violence (Hevia, 2012).



## Description of data and data source
_Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section._

This data originates from the Guttmacher Institute's Adding It Up project. The data contains numeric variables: percentages of pregnancy outcomes, rates of safe and unsafe abortions, percentage of various contraceptive usages, percentages of care received for various pregnancy complications, and costs for many variables including abortions and STIs. There are only three character variables that can be used to group the numeric variables: country name, region, and sub region. So far we have dvided the observations into "low", "medium", and "high" category of birth control usage. 

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
_State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis._

1. Is there a significant difference in the percentage of unplanned pregnancies between three contraceptive methods and no usage between regions of the world?

# Methods 

_Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement._
Reproducing this project requires R, RStudio, and Microsoft word. The README files in each folder contain descriptions of the documents located in that folder to help guide users through the reproducible processes. Begin with the processing-file.qmd in the code > processing-code folder. This file loads the original dataset from the Guttmacher Institute's Adding It Up project, loads the codebook for the dataset, and glimpses at the data. We chose 30 variables to clean to find the percentage of unintended pregnancies based on each type of contraceptive methods: long acting reversible and sterilization methods, short acting reversible methods, traditional methods, and no contraceptive usage. After the missing data was explored, we chose to use the percentage of unintended pregnancies variables related to each method of birth control because the total variable had unexplained missingness. The processed data is saved in the data > processed-data folder as processeddata.rds. 

The next step is exploratory data analysis. The eda.qmd file in the code > eda-code folder contains all the code for this process. We produce a couple summary tables before we begin a simple exploration of trends in percentage of unintended pregnancies by country in our first set of histograms. The second set of histograms explore contraceptive usage methods by country. These graphs revealed outliers, so we standardized by population size for each country. The next sets of plots are line graphs showing total usage of contraceptive methods to percentage of unintended pregnancies associated with that method. All of these figures are saved in the Supplementary-Material.qmd file in the products > manuscript > supplement folder. The last two sets of plots contain line graphs of the relationship between the two variables stratified by region and violin plots displaying the relationship between percentage of unintended pregnancies and the categorical usage variable created during processing, which are included in this manuscript. The exploratory data analysis process led to another version of the processed data with standardized total usage variables saved as processeddata2.rds in the data > procsssed-data folder. 

Step three is the statistical analayis and model fitting portion found in the statistical-analysis.qmd file in the code > analysis-code folder. 

The Manuscript.qmd file for this document can be found in the products > manuscript folder. 

## Schematic of workflow

Sometimes you might want to show a schematic diagram/figure that was not created with code (if you can do it with code, do it). is an example of some - completely random/unrelated - schematic that was generated with Biorender.
We store those figures in the `assets` folder.

```{r}
#| label: fig-schematic
#| fig-cap: "A figure that is manually generated and shows some overview/schematic. This has nothing to do with the data, it's just a random one from one of our projects I found and placed here."
#| echo: FALSE
# knitr::include_graphics(here("products","assets","antigen-recognition.png")) #commented out for the sake of knitting the file at this stage in the project 
```


## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._


## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._


## Statistical analysis
_Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis (Project Part 2)
The first priority when cleaning the data was analyzing missing values, and our findings can be seen @tbl-summarytable. We found that the `pct_upreg` variable containing the percentage of unintended pregnancies is unreliable due to missing data that could not be explained. We decided to use the variables with percentage of unintended pregnancies related to each birth control method as our outcome variables because they are complete and were found directly based on the AIU protocol information. We printed the summary table here because it was useful in determining missingness and creating a new factor variable for the usage of each birth control method at the factor level later in the processing sequence. 
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Summary table of numeric variables"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable<- readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytable.rds")
kable(resulttable)
```

We explored the distribution of the countries by five categorical variables: `region`, `larcster_usage`, `sarc_usage`, `trad_usage`, and `none_usage` which is displayed in @tbl-summarytable2. We found that most countries are located in Africa followed by Asia and Latin America/the Caribbean. Only 20 countries have high usage of long acting reversible and sterilization methods compared to 33 countries with high usage of short acting reversible and traditional methods. It is interesting that the distributions for short acting reversible method, traditional method, and no method usages are the same. 
```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable2
#| tbl-cap: "Summary table for categorical variables"
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 <- readRDS("../../results/tables/summarytablecat.rds")
kable(resulttable2)
```

We created a multitude of exploratory plots to understand our data better. The histograms of percent of unintended pregnancies related to each method of birth control showed discrepancies in skewness which can be seen @exploratory-result. The `pct_upreg_larcster` and `pct_upreg_trad` variables are highly skewed right, which shows that more countries experience lower rates of unintended pregnancies when using these methods. The `pct_upreg_sarc` histogram is not as skewed. It shows that the percentage of unintended pregnancies among those using short acting reversible methods varies more between countries compared to long acting reversible methods. The histogram for `pct_upreg_none` shows that more countries report a higher percentage of unintended pregnancies among women who do not use any contraception, but it varies widely by country. 
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result
#| fig-cap: "Histograms of Percentage of Unintended Pregnancy Use by Birth Control Method"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_larcster_distribution.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_sarc_distribution.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_trad_distribution.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_nouse_distribution.png"))
```

The next set of variables we explored were the total counts of women using each birth control method. There were two large outliers that prevented the graphs from being useful. After exploring the outliers, we standardized using the population size of reproductive aged women (15-49 years). There is a positive association between the percentage of unintended pregnancies and the total number of women using that method of birth control for all three methods and those not using any method, which is to be expected. There is more variation among those using SARMs and traditional methods compared to those using long-acting reversible methods. Additionally, the lowest percentage in this category is around 35%, which is much higher than the percentages associated with the three birth control methods. These figures can be seen @exploratory-result2.
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result2
#| fig-cap: "Relationship between Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies and Standardized Population Totals"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctuppreg_totallarcster.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totalsarc.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totaltrad.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_totalnone.png"))
```

We stratified these four graphs by region to examine how the relationships differ across each of the 6 regions which is shown in @exploratory-result3 . The long acting reversible and sterilization methods graph is a little difficult to decipher, but Asia has the highest percentages of unintended pregnancies, followed by Latin America/the Caribbean and Africa. The graph for short acting reversible methods shows clearer differences between regions, and Latin America/the Caribbean leads in the percentage of unintended pregnancies in this category, but Africa shows the sharpest increase in percentage of unintended pregnancies as the total population increases.Among women using traditional birth control methods, Europe has the sharpest increase in unintended pregnancies as population increases, but Asia has the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies in this category. The graph for women not using any birth control methods shows that Oceania has the highest percentage of unintended pregnancies. 
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result3
#| fig-cap: "Percentage of Unintended Pregnancies Stratified by Region"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_larcster_stratified.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_sarc_stratified.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_trad_stratified.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "pctupreg_none_stratified.png"))
```

The last set of plots we created to explore the data are violin plots using the categorical usage variables for each birth control method as shown in @exploratory-result4. The first violin plot shows that the distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies varies a lot among usage levels of long acting reversible and sterilization methods. High usage countries have a consistent percentage of unintended pregnancies, but countries with a medium usage level tend to have lower percentages of unintended pregnancies. It appears that the distribution of short acting reversible method usage is skewed towards lower percentages of unintended pregnancies across all usage levels, suggesting that more countries have lower percentage of unintended pregnancies among women using this method. Among women using traditional birth control methods, the distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies is similar among medium and high usage countries, but low usage countries are skewed towards lower percentage of unintended pregnancies. While the distribution of percentage of unintended pregnancies is similar across the three usage levels for women not using any birth control method, the high usage countries appear to have a bottleneck in percentage of unintended pregnancies. The high and low usage countries appear to be skewed towards higher levels of unintended pregnancies, but the medium usage countries appear to have lower percentage of unintended pregnancies. 
```{r}
#| label: exploratory-result4
#| fig-cap: "Violin Plots with Birth Control Usage Levels"
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "larcster_pctupreg_violin.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "sarc_pctupreg_violin.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "trad_pctupreg_violin.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here("results", "figures", "exploratory-figures", "none_pctupreg_violin.png"))
```

## Basic statistical analysis

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
# knitr::include_graphics(here("results","height-weight-stratified.png")) #commented out for the sake of knitting our project at this stage
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
# resulttable2 = readRDS(here("results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
# knitr::kable(resulttable2) #commented out for the sake of knitting our project at this stage

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses. 

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
