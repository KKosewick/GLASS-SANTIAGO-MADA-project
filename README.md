# Overview

We used the template file and folder structure for a data analysis project/paper done with R/Quarto/Github from Dr. Andres Handel. 

# Pre-requisites

This data analysis project used R, Quarto, Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex. It is also assumed that you have a word processor installed (e.g. MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). You need that software stack to make use of this template.

# Project structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* The `renv` folder is automatically generated by the `renv` package, and is
used to keep track of packages.
* See the various `README.md` files in those folders for some more information.

# Getting started

This project is created from a Github template repository. The best way to get it and start using it is [by following these steps.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Once you got the repository, you can check out the examples by executing them in order. First run the processing code, which will produce the processed data. Then run the analysis scripts, which will take the processed data and produce some results. Then you can run the manuscript, poster and slides example files in any order. Those files pull in the generated results and display them. These files also pull in references from the `bibtex` file and format them according to the CSL style.

You can read about keeping track of projects with `renv`
[here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).
Basically, whenever you install new packages or update old packages, you need
to run `renv::snapshot()` to update the `renv.lock` file, which is a list of
packages and versions that the package uses. When you open the R project on a
new computer, you can run `renv::restore()` to reinstall all the packages that
you recorded in the `renv.lock` file.

# How to reproduce the project
Begin with the `processing-filev1.qmd` file located in the `processing-code` folder inside the `code` folder to process the raw data that is stored in the `raw-data` folder located inside the `data` folder. This document will clean all the variables for analysis and save them in the `processeddata.rds` file located inside the `processed-data` folder found inside the `data`folder. Use this data file for reproducing the exploratory data analysis process that models the outcome, predictor variable, and covariates.
